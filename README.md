## Breast Cancer Detection by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women worldwide. When cancer is diagnosed at an early stage (first stage), the success rate of breast cancer treatment is over 90%. The aim of this project is to develop a model to detect whether the tumor image in the existing dataset is benign or malignant. 

- In this project, Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis) is used. The dataset BreaKHis is divided into two main groups: benign tumors and malignant tumors. There is no need to do any preprocessing, filtering or other special treatment to use this dataset in the model.
 
- A CNN model was developed for this project and tumor images from the dataset were added to this model. Numerical statistics of benign and malignant tumor images in the data set were determined. As a result, one benign tumor image and one malignant tumor image were shown. Finally, accuracy and loss values were determined. The accuracy of the model resulted in 98.99%.
